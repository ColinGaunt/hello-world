# hello-world
the first git hub repository I have created
Hi, my name is Colin Gaunt, and I am a sustainability analyst for a clothing company. I am just getting started with coding in python. I am currently taking the Google intro to Python course offered on coursera, and figured it was time to get aquainted with Github. I am a complete novice at anything coding related, but I am excited to see where I can get a year from now.
